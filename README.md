## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/joybiswas007/modbot-tg.git 
    cd modbot-tg
    ```
2. **Copy the example config file**
    ```
    cp example.modbot.yaml .modbot.yaml
    ```
3. **Edit `.modbot.yaml` and configure the bot settings as needed.**

## MakeFile
Build the application
```bash
make build
```
Run the application
```bash
make run
```
Run the test suite:
```bash
make test
```
Clean up binary from the last build:
```bash
make clean
```

Runing the bot:
```
./modbot
```
or pass the config file
```
./modbot -config /path/to/modbot.yaml
```

**If you don't specify a config path, the bot will look for .modbot.yaml in the directory from which it is running.**

## Note on Database
No manual setup is required for the database. Upon starting the bot, the database will be automatically migrated.


## BP System (Bonus Points)

The bot tracks message counts and rewards users with points based on their activity in the group. Below is how the default point system works:

### **Default Point Distribution**
- **Text Messages:** Users receive a random number of points between `1` and `5`.
- **Photo:** `+1` point  
- **Document:** `+1` point  
- **Animation (GIFs):** `+1` point  
- **Audio:** `+1` point  
- **Sticker:** `+1` point  

These values are **configurable**, meaning the group owner can modify them based on their preferences.  

The more active a user is, the more points they earn, which can be used to redeem rewards from the shop.

### TODO

#### üöÄ Upcoming Features
- ~~[ ] **Buy Boost** - Users can purchase temporary boosts to earn extra points.~~
- [ ] **Gift Boost** - Users can gift boost benefits to other members.
- [ ] **Bonus Pool** - A shared pool where users contribute points, later distributed as rewards.
- [ ] **Global Double Bonus Event** - A special event where all point earnings are doubled for a limited time.

#### ‚ö† Rule Enforcement
- ~~[ ] **Penalty Command** - Admins can deduct points from users who break group rules.~~
